## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Happy Wear is an innovative clothing app designed to help users find their perfect outfit with a user-friendly input system that resembles the popular dating app, Tinder. The app allows users to browse through a vast collection of clothing items and select those that best match their style and preferences.

The user input system of Happy Wear is simple and intuitive, allowing users to swipe right on clothes they like and swipe left on those they don't. This input method makes it easy for users to quickly filter through items and find the ones that resonate with their sense of style.

One of the key features of Happy Wear is its algorithm, which takes into account the user's previous swipes and preferences to suggest clothing items that are likely to appeal to them. This means that the more a user interacts with the app, the better it becomes at understanding their preferences and suggesting items that are tailored to their unique style.

Happy Wear also offers a range of filters that allow users to narrow down their search results based on specific criteria such as color, size, and price range. This makes it easy for users to find exactly what they're looking for and avoid wasting time scrolling through items that don't meet their needs.

Additionally, the app includes a social aspect that allows users to share their favorite outfits with friends and receive feedback on their style choices. This feature encourages users to engage with the app and build a community of like-minded individuals who share their passion for fashion.

In summary, Happy Wear is a clothing app that offers a unique user input system inspired by Tinder, making it easy for users to find their perfect outfit. Its intuitive interface, personalized recommendations, and social features make it a must-have for anyone looking to upgrade their fashion game.
